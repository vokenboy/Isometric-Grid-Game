# Isometric Game Project

## Overview

This isometric game project is a Java application that uses Swing to render an isometric grid similar to the one seen in classic games like Fallout 1. The game features an interactive grid where a player can move around by clicking on the desired tile. The project is structured using MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles and demonstrates handling mouse events, rendering graphics, and manipulating game elements in an isometric view.

## Inspiration

The design and gameplay mechanics are inspired by the classic RPG Fallout 1, which features a rich post-apocalyptic world depicted in an isometric perspective. This project aims to recreate a simplified version of Fallout's engaging gameplay experience and its unique graphical style.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files in the `main/java` directory. You can use a command like:
3. Run the compiled program by navigating to the `main` directory and executing:
4. The game window should appear where you can interact with the isometric grid.
